## Credits

I heavily used GitHub's copilot to write this code. It's a great tool to write code faster. You can try it out [here](https://copilot.github.com/). Trust me, you'll love it ;)

This project is highly inspired by [@Stephen Grider's](https://github.com/StephenGrider/) GraphQL user project: https://github.com/StephenGrider/GraphQLCasts/tree/master/users - Thanks Stephen for the awesome course!

If you're checking out this repo, you should definitely follow him on GitHub!
