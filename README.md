# Introduction to GraphQL

1. Let's take some REST!
2. Let's create a mini-LinkedIn model?
3. But wait, we shouldn't always REST!
4. Well then, what's the solution?
5. Let's take a look at our Graphical tool (ah well, that's GraphiQL)
6. Let's create our own server first
7. It's time to write some queries
8. GETing that was cool, but what about POSTing that?
9. Let's write some mutations
10. But wait, we can't ship the GraphiQL to users, right?
11. Can I try hitting a GQL query with Postman REST request :0
12. Doing that would become a mess in the frontend, so we have these clients.

## Problem with RESTing too much

1. Under-fetching (If you need more data than what the single endpoint supports, you'll have to call multiple APIs)
2. Over-fetching (If you need less data than what the endpoint is giving, you're just wasting your users data pack)
